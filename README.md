# iPod Classic Simulator in iOS üéµ

**‚ö†Ô∏è Just a fun hobby project without any serious ambitions!**

This is a nostalgic recreation of the classic iPod interface for iOS. Currently, it has performance issues and the Apple Music library integration doesn't work properly, but it's still a fun experiment in recreating that old-school iPod experience we all loved.

## Features

- Circular click wheel with gesture recognition
- Menu navigation that feels like the real thing
- Basic music playback
- Apple Music library integration
- Haptic feedback for that tactile experience

## Issues

- Performance is not great
- Apple Music library integration is unreliable
- DRM-protected songs may not play
- Various bugs and quirks throughout

## Why?

Because sometimes you just want to build something fun without worrying about making it perfect. This project is all about nostalgia.

## Requirements

## Installation
