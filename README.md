# iPod Classic Simulator in iOS üéµ

**‚ö†Ô∏è Just a fun hobby project without any serious ambitions!**

This is a nostalgic recreation of the classic iPod interface for iOS. Currently, it has performance issues and the Apple Music library integration doesn't work properly, but it's still a fun experiment in recreating that old-school iPod experience we all loved.
